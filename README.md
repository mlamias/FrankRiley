CWO Riley Has Enjoyed Varied Career Virginia Biggins, Times-Herald Staff Writer. CWO (W4) Frank J. Riley of Langley Air Force Base has been in military service about 30 years, yet he's never been to war nor has he ever fired a shot in anger. 

"For a while there I was a little sensitive about this situation," laughed Riley, "But, now I feel maybe I've established some kind of record." 

Riley retires from active service next March. 

He is now aircraft support avionics officer in the Avionics Maintenance Engineering Section of the deputy chief of staff, materiel, headquarters, Tactical Air Command. 

His duties consists of monitoring all avionics maintenance throughout TAC relative to avionics maintenance, modifications and installation of new avionics subsystems employed in all tactical support, training, and special operations aircraft. 

Prior to reporting to Langley, Riley was assigned to the avionics division of the 38th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Ramstein, Germany. The wing flies the RF4C Phantom. 

While assigned to the 26th TRW, the warrant officer was instrumental in aiding the squadron to win the aerial reconnaissance night photography competition against the Royal Air Force. The British have held the record for 12 years, before the 26th picked up the award in May 1968, holding it for two consecutive years. 

Riley entered the Army Air Corps on Oct 1, 1940, while visiting his brother, John who was stationed at Ft. Meade, Md. 

"I picked the Army Air Corps simply because I wanted to fly airplanes," the warrant officer recalled. "However, I didn't' know at the time enlisted personnel were not qualified for this kind of duty." 

So, the young soldier took a series of tests and ended up in aircraft mechanics worked, attending maintenance specialist school at Chanute Field, Ill. Later, he attended aircraft instruments school, subsequently instructing others at the school in this area. 

When the Air Training Command opened up another field at Keesler Field, Miss., Riley was sent there as one of a cadre to establish the maintenance training facility there. 

"Talking about bare base existence, we really had it there for a while," Riley recalled. "We lived there and worked in tents and ate out of mess kits." 

World War II was underway at the time, and Riley still had it in his mind to fly airplanes. The Army was looking for more pilots in those early war days, and even established a flying sergeant's squadron for enlisted men. However, if applicants could pass a two-year college equivalent test, they could enter aviation cadets. 

"I remember going up for those tests, actually going to a nun schoolteacher and asking her to give me a two-year college course in two-months. She taught me well, and I was one of 12 out of 36 applicants who passed the tests," he said. 

The warrant officer then went to Kelly Field and Coleman Field, Tex., for flight training, first in the PT19 low-wing, monoplanes. He later took advanced flight training in the BT-13 affectionately dubbed the Vulte Vibrator at Goodfellow Field, Tex. Subsequent training in multi-engine aircraft took place at Lubbock Field, Tex., in AT-17, AT-9 and AT-10 aircraft. 

"Upon graduation, we were slated for the P38 fighter plane and were read to get into the action. . . into the war. But, that wasn't to be. I was reassigned to Hondo, Tex., where I flew student navigators in the AT-7, now called the C45s, C60s, and B34s," Riley said. 

It was about that time early in 1943, Riley met and married his wife Flora Ruth, who lived then in San Antonio, Tex. He remained in that area of the country until October 1944, building up approximately 1,300 hours of flying time in military planes. 

He later attended B26 school in Dodge City, Kan., in preparation for "D" Day and the big push. He was reassigned to advanced overseas training school at Columbia, S.C., there to prepare for flight to England and the war zone. He had accumulated about 300 hours in the Martin Marauder and the Douglas A 26 aircraft, but he never got to the war. It was 1945 and the A-bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. 

Riley has by that time advanced to the rank of second lieutenant, through his air cadet and subsequent advanced training. In November 1945, he resigned from military service. 

"I had the big idea that I would look to the airlines for a job, but I soon found out that they wanted pilots with 4,000 hours of flying time, or more. I got a job with an insurance firm, and later worked for a candy factory. It didn't take me long, only 85 days, to make up my mind to return to the service," he said. 

So, Riley reenlisted as a master sergeant, working his way up to his present chief warrant officer status. He also returned to this first job, that of aircraft instrument maintenance at Brook Field, Tex. He stayed at the field until August 1947 as non-commissioned officer in charge of the aircraft field maintenance instrument repair facility. 

That same year, he applied for radar mechanics training at Boca Raton, Fla. He was graduated with honors from the school, and named best student in his class. 

Riley, then, returned to Brooks Field for a short period, and later reassigned as aircraft radar mechanic to the 98th Bomb Group, 98th Bomb Wing, in Spokane, Wash. The wing inventoried B50s and B29s. 

He was reassigned to Keesler Field for advanced radar training, and again selected to become an instructor – teaching radar fundamentals. Subsequently, he was assigned to implement and teach the Q24 bomb navigations system course for B29s and B50s. 

"We started out with a class of 12 students, but soon it turned into a 24-hour-a-day operation, with 16 classes given a day. I was then advanced to field instructor, teaching other instructors they chourse to be presented," he said. 

The warrant officer then reported to the National Bureau of Standards for special projects geared for nuclear development. He was heavily involved in "Operation Green House" and "Operation Castle," project designations for nuclear tests on Eniwetok, and atoll in the vicinity of the Marshall, Islands. 

His job in "Green House" was to develop the prototype and production model of instruments required to measure nuclear yield and radiation. 

In May 1951, Riley was reassigned to Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M. with the 4925th Test Group, Atomic for further work in nuclear development. His duty was to provide more advanced measurement instrumentation for the 1953-54 nuclear tests on Eniwetok. He was selected to provide complete support for all participating commands in maintenance and repair of all radar, radio and associated electronics systems. 

Riley spent several months on Eniwetok prior to the tests aiding in development of complete facilities for the aerospace test equipment. He received personal commendations from top military leaders for his participation in the project. 

During the 1954-57 period, he was assigned to the inspector general's office of the Air Force's Special Weapons Command at Kirtland base. 

He then entered the space field in late 1957 upon assignment at Patrick Air Force Base, Fla., as avionics support officer of the Atlantic Missile Test Range. Riley was instrumental gain in establishing new electronics facilities for the range. His assignment was to oversee maintenance, calibration, repair, and alignment of all special and standard electronics equipment in support of the missile development. 

He participated in support activities for Project Mercury, Gemini –the two-man spacecraft and Apollo, the three-man vehicle. 

Right after the Mercury project ended, Riley left Patrick base for a short while and was reassigned to the 47th Bomb Wing in England. Again he was avionics officer in charge of radar, radio and electronics systems for the B66 aircraft, until the wing was deactivated in 1963. At the same time, the warrant officer also served as commissary officer to the wing. 

He returned from England in 1964, again reporting to Patrick Air Force Base and continued support of the Project Gemini flights, and follow-on planning for Project Apollo through early 1966. 

Riley, his wife, and four of their five children presently reside in Bethel Manor. Their son Michael, 20, is pursuing a commercial art career, while another son, Mark Allen, 18, is a senior at York High School. Daughter Betty Jeanne "BJ," 14, is a ninth grader at Tabb Junior High and a second daughter Terry Ann, 9, is in the fourth grade at Bethel Elementary School. There is a married daughter, Patricia, who is the wife of Air Force captain, a missile control officer, presently assigned to Malstrom Air Force Base.
